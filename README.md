# Sub0 DevTools

First install the dependencies and build:

```bash
  npm install
  npm run build
```

Then run:

```bash
  npm link
``` 

This will create a command available in your PATH called ```sub0_devtools```.

Now run ```sub0_devtools``` in the same path as sub0_kickstart where your ```.env``` file is defined to see the UI.
